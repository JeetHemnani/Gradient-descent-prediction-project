Linear Regression with Gradient Descent in Python
A step-by-step implementation of Linear Regression using Gradient Descent from scratch using Python and NumPy.

🧠Project Overview-:

This project demonstrates how to implement linear regression using gradient descent from scratch.
Synthetic data is generated to simulate a linear relationship.
Gradient Descent is used to optimize the model parameters.
Performance is measured using MSE and R² Score.
The model is visualized using matplotlib.
The final model is saved and loaded using joblib.




💡How It Works-:

Generate synthetic data
Implement hypothesis function
Implement gradient descent
Plot cost reduction over iterations
Make predictions
Evaluate model performance
Save and load model



🏆 Results-:

Mean Squared Error: 1.33
R² Score: 0.61




📊 Plots-:

Cost reduction over iterations
Actual vs. Predicted values
